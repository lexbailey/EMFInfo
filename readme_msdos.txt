EMF Info for MS-DOS is provided as two executable files, and a set of data files.

emfi.exe - which uses all the fancy features for colours and whatnot
emfi_t.exe - a plain-text only version of EMF Info, which can be used on earlier DOS versions that do not support colour or terminal emulation.

If emfi.exe produces garbage on the screen, use emfi_t.exe instead.
